Services:

Why to use services:
1. Reusable code.
2. Business rules are at common place.
3. Can be used to share some data across application.
4. We can achieve loosely coupled system.

How to create a service:
1. run "ng g service <service-name>"

Injectable(): its a decorator, which tells angular this class is a service.

1. Create a service, and implment all methods
2. Register our service using providers property

3. To inject a service, use the constructor to inject a service.

DI:  (Dependency Injction)
1. Most widely used and one of the most important design pattern.
2. We should never create an instance directly in our class.

Singleton: 
1. Only one instance of our class gets created.
2. To make a service singleton, Register it in root module.

Class Based Services:
1. Services with class

{ provide: StudentService, useClass: NewstudentService } //use this syntax to Register a service.

Non-Class Based Services
1. valueProvider - httpclient
2. factoryProvider - Routing
