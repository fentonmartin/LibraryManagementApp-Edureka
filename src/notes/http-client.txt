Why to use http:
1. To interact with our RestFul API or any third party API.
2. To get and save the data

How to use:
1. import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; and add in imports array.


To typeCast use below syntax:
 return this.http.get<Posts[]>('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

To get progress of API call.

const httpRequest = new HttpRequest('GET', 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', { reportProgress: true });
    return this.http.request(httpRequest);
  }
