1. constructor : Should be used to initilize the component.
2. ngOnInit :  This is lifecycle event where we can do some binding on load.
3. ngOnChanges : It gets called before the onInit in child and after any changes are made to the input 
property.
4. ngDoCheck :  This event will be called after init and after any event is fired.
Never implement ngOnChanges and ngDoCheck both in a single component.

all children component is available.
6. ngOnDestroy  :  This method is usefull to release some resources and we can also handle some
busines  rules, like showing popup in case user has a incomplete form.
