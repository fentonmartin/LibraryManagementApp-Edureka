Forms are like necessary part of any application.
<form> tag will be used to create a form.

Dashboards apps may or may not have forms.

Type Forms:
1. Template driven Forms
2. Reactive Forms

How to use template driven forms:
1. import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
2. add FormsModule to imports array.

We can achieve 2 way data binding using ngModel.
In 2 way data binding, values will be reflected on View and Controller as well.

validation:
1. create an instance of form tag

properties:
invalid
valid
pristine
dirty

Why to use Reactive forms:
1. we have a complex form where we want to add control dynamically.
2. We want to keep control in TS file.

How to use Reactive forms:
1. import ReactiveFormModule and add in imports array.
2. import FormGroup and declare a variable of FormGroup type, which will be our form.
3. import FormBuilder service, which will help us to create/add controls.
4. Import FormControl to add control to the form.
5. in case we want arrary we will use FormArray.

in HTML tags to remember:
1. formGroup
2. formGroupName
3. formArrayName
4. formControlName
