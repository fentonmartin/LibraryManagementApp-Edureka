Pre-Requisite:
Parent and child relationship between the components. 

What is component interaction:
1. The way to share some data between multiple components.

Why to use component interaction:
1. So we can share the data between multiple components.

How to achieve component interaction:

1. @Input() - Will be used to send data to child component
a. Create a property in child component, should have same datatype which we want to send from Parent
b. pass the data using property binding.

2. @Output() - Will be used to send data from chile to parent components
a. Define an EventEmitter using the @Output
b. use event binding to handle the event in parent component

ViewChild:
1. In case we want full control over any child component

DisAdvantages:
1. Creates tight coupling between components


ViewChildren: 
1. In case we have multiple components placed on our html of same type, and
we want to control all of them in TS file.
